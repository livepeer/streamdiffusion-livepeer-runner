"""Curated, SFW prompt bank for the auto-cycler.

Deliberately *not* an LLM/prompt-model: for a public live stream you want
deterministic, safe output, so every token here is hand-vetted. It's a template
combinator (style x modifier) — small banks, large variety. Because this is
img2img restyle, prompts are **style-forward** (the subject comes from the video),
not scene descriptions.

Edit the lists to taste; keep them SFW.
